# Tangent Planes Plot 3D
 Let A be a 2×2 matrix and let the quadratic function f : R<sup>2</sup> → R, f(x) = x<sup>T</sup>Ax.
1. Give two (different) matrices A such that f has a unique minimum.
1. Give two (different) matrices A such that f has a unique maximum.
1. Give two (different) matrices A such that f has a unique saddle point.

For each matrix A plot the function f and its tangent plane in a fixed point.
